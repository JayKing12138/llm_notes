The statement is factually wrong.\n\n3) Option B: \"Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity\" - This is correct. Adaptive immunity takes time to develop (days to weeks) while innate immunity responds immediately.\n\n4) Option C: \"Innate immunity activates a humoral response\" - This is partially correct. Innate immunity can involve humoral components like complement proteins, but the humoral response is more specifically associated with adaptive immunity.\n\n5) Option D: \"Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells\" - This is correct. Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells that play a key role in initiating adaptive immune responses.\n\n6) The key error is in option A - it incorrectly identifies innate immunity as the adaptive immune response, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of immunology.\n\nANSWER: A", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "biology", "question_id": 2814}}
