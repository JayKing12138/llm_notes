The contract stated that the owner was to pay the landscaper's son, which means the son was the intended beneficiary.\n\n2) For a third party beneficiary to have rights under a contract, they must be:\n- An intended beneficiary (not an incidental one)\n- The contract must have been made with the intention that the third party would benefit\n- The third party must have been identified in the contract\n\n3) In this case, the son was specifically named as the recipient of payment, so he was an intended beneficiary.\n\n4) The landscaper changed the terms of payment after completing the work, which constitutes a modification of the contract. However, this doesn't negate the original intention that the son would receive the payment.\n\n5) The son's rights as an intended beneficiary would generally survive even if the contract terms are changed, unless the change was made with the son's consent or the original contract was unenforceable.\n\n6) Looking at the options:\n- Option B correctly identifies that the son was the intended beneficiary\n- Option I also correctly identifies the son as a third party beneficiary\n- However, option B is more precise as it directly addresses the legal principle of intended beneficiary\n\n7) The key legal principle here is that an intended beneficiary has rights under a contract even if the terms are later changed, unless the change was made with the beneficiary's consent.\n\n8) Option J suggests the agreement was modified, which would deprive the son of rights - but this isn't necessarily true in this situation.\n\nANSWER: B", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "law", "question_id": 907}}
