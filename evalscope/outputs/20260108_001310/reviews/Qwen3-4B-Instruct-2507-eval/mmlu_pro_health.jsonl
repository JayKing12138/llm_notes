It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphocreatine to ADP to form ATP.\n\n2) The enzyme activity of creatine kinase is sensitive to changes in intracellular conditions:\n- When intracellular ADP levels rise (indicating energy depletion), CK activity increases to help regenerate ATP\n- CK activity is also pH-sensitive\n- The enzyme works optimally in a slightly alkaline environment\n\n3) Let's evaluate each option:\n- A) CK activity decreases as pH drops, not increases\n- B) Type II fibers have higher CK activity than Type I fibers\n- C) Endurance training doesn't significantly increase CK activity\n- D) Type II fibers have much higher CK activity than Type I\n- E) CK activity decreases when pH falls below 6.9\n- F) When ADP rises, CK activity increases to help regenerate ATP\n- G) CK activity decreases when pH falls below 6.9\n- H) ADP rise increases CK activity, not decreases it\n\n4) The key relationship is that when intracellular ADP rises (indicating energy demand), creatine kinase activity increases to help restore ATP levels.\n\n5) This is a well-documented physiological response - CK activity increases in response to rising ADP levels.\n\nANSWER: F", "explanation": null, "metadata": {}, "main_score_name": null}, "sample_id": 73, "group_id": 73, "sample_metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "health", "question_id": 6075}}}
