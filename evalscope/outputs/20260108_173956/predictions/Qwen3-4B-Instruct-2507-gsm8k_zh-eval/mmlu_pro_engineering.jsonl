We need to find the weighted average of the absorption.\n\n5) The total absorbed power would be:\n   - For radiation above 2.7 μm: 95% of the radiation\n   - For radiation below 2.7 μm: 30% of the radiation\n\n6) Since we don't have the exact distribution, we need to assume the radiation is distributed across all wavelengths. The total absorbed power would be a weighted average of these two values.\n\n7) The calculation would be:\n   - If we assume equal distribution of radiation above and below 2.7 μm, then:\n   - Absorbed power = 0.5 × 1850 × 0.95 + 0.5 × 1850 × 0.30\n   - = 0.5 × 1850 × (0.95 + 0.30)\n   - = 0.5 × 1850 × 1.25\n   - = 0.5 × 2312.5\n   - = 1156.25 W/m²\n\n8) However, this doesn't match any options. Let me reconsider.\n\n9) Looking at the options, we see that 1850 W/m² is the original power, and the absorbed power should be less than this.\n\n10) The most reasonable calculation would be a weighted average of 95% and 30%, which would give us a value between 30% and 95% of 1850.\n\n11) A reasonable estimate would be around 70% of 1850 = 1295 W/m², but this still doesn't match.\n\n12) Looking at the options, 1725 W/m² is 93.2% of 1850, which is close to 95% but not quite.\n\n13) 1500 W/m² is 81.1% of 1850, which seems reasonable.\n\n14) Given the options and the absorption percentages, 1725 W/m² seems to be the closest reasonable answer.\n\nANSWER: E", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "engineering", "question_id": 11371}}
