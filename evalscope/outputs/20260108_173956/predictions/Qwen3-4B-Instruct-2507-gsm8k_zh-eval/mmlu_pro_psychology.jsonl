The key issue is whether these views interfere with the therapeutic process.\n\n3) According to ethical standards (like the APA Ethics Code), therapists must:\n- Maintain professional boundaries\n- Avoid conflicts of interest\n- Ensure the therapeutic relationship is effective\n- Not allow personal biases to interfere with treatment\n\n4) Looking at the options:\n- Option A is premature - discussing discomfort in the first session isn't appropriate\n- Option B ignores ethical concerns about personal bias\n- Option C is reasonable - political views should only be discussed if relevant to therapy\n- Option D is inappropriate - it's not the therapist's role to refer based on political views\n- Option E is ethically problematic - it's not justified to decline therapy based on political differences\n- Option F is not appropriate - continuing therapy without addressing the issue is problematic\n- Option G is unprofessional and violates ethical boundaries\n- Option H is inappropriate - it's not the therapist's role to demand changes\n- Option I is not relevant - referrals aren't needed for political differences\n\n5) The most ethical approach is to recognize that political views are not relevant to therapy unless they impact the therapeutic process. The therapist should maintain professional boundaries while ensuring the therapeutic relationship remains effective.\n\nANSWER: C", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "psychology", "question_id": 1987}}

Confabulation refers to making up stories or responses that aren't based on what's actually seen in the inkblot.\n\n2) The key point in the question is that the examinee has \"overgeneralized from a part of the inkblot to the whole.\" This means they're interpreting a small part of the image as representing the entire image.\n\n3) This type of response is typically associated with:\n- Difficulty in perceiving details\n- Difficulty in making accurate interpretations\n- Possible cognitive or emotional disturbances\n\n4) Looking at the options:\n- A) Abstract concept perception isn't directly related to overgeneralization\n- B) Stress/anxiety could be a factor but isn't specifically linked to this pattern\n- C) Self-esteem isn't directly related to this specific response\n- D) Intelligence and creativity aren't indicated by this pattern\n- E) Attention to detail is directly related to overgeneralization\n- F) Immediate gratification isn't related\n- G) This is a strong possibility as confabulation can indicate underlying cognitive or emotional issues\n- H) Defensiveness/denial isn't specifically indicated\n- I) Imagination isn't the primary issue here\n- J) Introversion isn't directly related\n\n5) Confabulatory responses, especially overgeneralization, are often seen in conditions that affect cognitive processing, such as brain damage, intellectual disability, or emotional disturbances. These conditions can impair the ability to accurately interpret stimuli.\n\n6) The most comprehensive answer that encompasses the possibility of underlying cognitive or emotional issues is G.\n\nANSWER: G", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "psychology", "question_id": 1995}}

This refers to the asymmetry of a distribution. Positive skewness means the tail extends to the right, negative skewness means the tail extends to the left.\n\n2) To calculate skewness, I can use the formula:\n   Skewness = (3 × (Mean - Median)) / Standard Deviation\n\n3) Let me calculate the necessary statistics:\n   - Mean: Sum of (frequency × midpoint) / total frequency\n   - Median: Value at the (n+1)/2 position\n   - Standard deviation: Square root of (sum of (frequency × (midpoint - mean)²) / total frequency)\n\n4) First, calculate the total frequency:\n   6 + 15 + 24 + 33 + 22 = 100\n\n5) Calculate the mean:\n   (6×51.5 + 15×57.5 + 24×63.5 + 33×69.5 + 22×75.5) / 100\n   = (309 + 862.5 + 1524 + 2303.5 + 1661) / 100\n   = 4660 / 100 = 46.6\n\n6) Calculate the median:\n   Since n = 100, median is at position (100+1)/2 = 50.5\n   The 50.5th value falls in the 67-72 class (cumulative frequency: 6+15+24+33 = 78)\n\n7) Looking at the distribution pattern:\n   - The frequencies increase and then decrease\n   - The peak is at 67-72 class\n   - The tail extends to the left\n\n8) This indicates negative skewness (left-skewed)\n\n9) Looking at the options, negative values are B, D, I, J\n   The magnitude should be moderate since the distribution isn't extremely skewed\n\n10) Given the pattern and the options, -0.75 seems to be a reasonable value for moderate negative skewness.\n\nANSWER: I", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "psychology", "question_id": 2046}}
