We need to focus on the biological requirements for sperm production.\n\n3) Temperature is a critical factor in spermatogenesis. Sperm production requires a temperature that is 2-3°C lower than core body temperature.\n\n4) The scrotum is specialized to maintain this lower temperature through mechanisms like muscle contractions and blood flow regulation.\n\n5) The testes are sensitive to temperature changes - if they remain in the warmer abdominal cavity, the temperature is too high for proper sperm development.\n\n6) Looking at the options:\n- Option A directly addresses the temperature requirement for sperm development\n- Options B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J either misrepresent the biological mechanism or are incorrect\n\n7) The fundamental reason is that sperm production requires a cooler environment, which the scrotum provides through its specialized temperature regulation.\n\n8) This is well-documented in medical literature - the scrotum's role in maintaining optimal temperature for spermatogenesis is well-established.\n\nANSWER: A", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "biology", "question_id": 2851}}

Evolution is the change in allele frequencies in a population over time.\n\n2) The fundamental forces of evolution are:\n- Mutation (introduces new genetic variation)\n- Gene flow (migration between populations)\n- Genetic drift (random changes in allele frequencies)\n- Natural selection (differential survival and reproduction)\n\n3) Looking at the options:\n- Option A includes reproduction (not a force of evolution) and migration (should be gene flow)\n- Option B includes genetic hitchhiking (a specific phenomenon, not a major force)\n- Option C includes random mating (this maintains genetic equilibrium, not a force of evolution)\n- Option D includes mutation, gene flow (same as migration), migration, and natural selection - this looks correct\n- Option E includes adaptation (this is the result, not a force)\n- Option F includes \"movement\" instead of gene flow\n- Option G includes sexual selection (a type of natural selection)\n- Option H includes artificial selection (a human-driven process)\n- Option I includes \"genetic shift\" (not a standard term)\n- Option J is very similar to D but has a typo in \"genetic drift\"\n\n4) Option D correctly identifies the four major forces:\n- Mutation (source of new variation)\n- Gene flow (migration between populations)\n- Migration (same as gene flow)\n- Natural selection (differential survival)\n\n5) Note that gene flow and migration are essentially the same thing, so having both would be redundant. However, option D uses \"gene flow\" which is the more precise term.\n\nANSWER: D", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "biology", "question_id": 2901}}
