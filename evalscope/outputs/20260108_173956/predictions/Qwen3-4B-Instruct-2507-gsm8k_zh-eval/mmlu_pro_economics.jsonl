An oligopoly is a market structure characterized by a small number of large firms that are interdependent.\n\n2) Simply having a small number of firms isn't enough to define an oligopoly. The key characteristic is that these firms are interdependent - each firm's decisions (pricing, output, advertising) affect the others, and each firm must consider how its rivals might react.\n\n3) Looking at the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because size alone doesn't define oligopoly\n- Option B is wrong as government-owned firms don't define oligopoly\n- Option C correctly identifies the interdependence between firms\n- Option D is too simplistic and misses the interdependence aspect\n- Option E describes a monopoly\n- Option F describes perfect competition\n- Option G describes monopolistic competition\n- Option H describes a monopoly\n- Option I describes monopolistic competition\n- Option J is too simplistic\n\n4) The key element of an oligopoly is not just the number of firms, but the strategic interdependence between them. Firms must consider how their rivals will react to their decisions.\n\n5) Option C perfectly captures this essential feature of oligopolies - the need for firms to anticipate and consider the reactions of their competitors.\n\nANSWER: C", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-gsm8k_zh-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "economics", "question_id": 6871}}
