The group that gauged the emotional impact remembered many more words.

Most professional ethical guidelines (like those from the American Psychological Association) emphasize that therapists should provide services to all clients regardless of income, and that fees should be set based on a client's ability to pay, not just current income.\n\n2) A \"sliding scale\" based on current income is actually a common and generally accepted practice in mental health care. It's designed to make therapy accessible to people with lower incomes.\n\n3) However, ethical guidelines typically emphasize that fees should be based on a client's ability to pay, not just current income. This is because current income can be misleading - someone might have a high current income but low savings, or vice versa.\n\n4) Looking at the options:\n- Option B suggests it's ethically acceptable because it provides opportunities for lower income clients\n- Option F suggests it's ethically unacceptable as it can be discriminatory\n- Option J suggests it's ethically unacceptable because it treats clients inequitably\n\n5) While sliding scales are generally accepted, the key issue is that they're based on current income rather than ability to pay. This could be problematic because current income doesn't reflect a client's overall financial situation.\n\n6) The most accurate answer is that this practice is ethically questionable because it may not consider a client's overall financial situation, which is what ethical guidelines typically emphasize.\n\nANSWER: G", "explanation": null, "metadata": {}, "main_score_name": null}, "sample_id": 91, "group_id": 91, "sample_metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "psychology", "question_id": 2080}}}
