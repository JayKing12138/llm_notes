The key concept is that the distance from Earth follows a specific pattern in an elliptical orbit.\n\n3) In an elliptical orbit, the distance from Earth at any angle can be calculated using the formula:\n   r(θ) = (r_p * (1 - e²)) / (1 + e*cos(θ))\n   where:\n   - r_p is perigee distance\n   - e is eccentricity\n   - θ is the angle from perigee\n\n4) First, let's find the semi-major axis:\n   a = (perigee + apogee)/2 = (300 + 3500)/2 = 1900 km\n\n5) The eccentricity e can be found as:\n   e = (apogee - perigee)/(apogee + perigee) = (3500 - 300)/(3500 + 300) = 3200/3800 ≈ 0.842\n\n6) At 90° from perigee, we need to find the distance.
