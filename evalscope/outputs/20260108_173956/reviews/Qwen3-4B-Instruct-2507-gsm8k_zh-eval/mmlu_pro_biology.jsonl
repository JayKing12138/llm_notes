The rate of increase is equal to the mutation rate times the frequency of the original allele.\n\n5) The formula for change in allele frequency due to mutation is:\n   Δq = μ × p\n   where:\n   - Δq is the change in frequency\n   - μ is the mutation rate\n   - p is the frequency of the original allele\n\n6) We need to find the number of generations (t) such that:\n   0.01 = (2 × 10^-6) × 0.02 × t\n\n7) Solving for t:\n   t = 0.01 / (2 × 10^-6 × 0.02)\n   t = 0.01 / (4 × 10^-8)\n   t = 2.5 × 10^5\n   t = 250,000 generations\n\nWait, this doesn't match any options.
