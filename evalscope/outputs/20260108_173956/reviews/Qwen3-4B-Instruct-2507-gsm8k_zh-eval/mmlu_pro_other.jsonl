Shells made by these organisms accumulated and lithified, forming the sandstone.\nB) A meteorite impact created a crater. The impact pulverized rock into sand-sized particles that later lithified into sandstone.\nC) A forest grew, died, and decayed on top of a layer of shale. The organic material transformed into sandstone over time.\nD) The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.\nE) Mud was deposited and lithified. Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.\nF) A volcano erupted, sending lava out over a layer of shale. The lava cooled and hardened into sandstone.\nG) A river carried silt and clay that settled over a layer of shale. Over time, this material compacted into sandstone.\nH) Tectonic activity pushed sandstone rock from deep within the Earth's surface to just above a layer of shale.\n", "target": "D", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"acc": 0.0}, "extracted_prediction": "G", "prediction": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for - a sequence where sandstone forms directly above shale in bedrock.\n\n2) Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of sand-sized particles.
