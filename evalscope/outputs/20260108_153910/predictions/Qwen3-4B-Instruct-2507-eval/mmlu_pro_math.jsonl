This could work, but it might not give us the best representation of country-level differences.\n\n5) A stratified sample (option F) divides the population into distinct groups (strata) based on country, then samples from each group. This ensures representation from each country, which is exactly what we need given the country-level differences in opinions.\n\n6) The stratified approach ensures that each country is properly represented in the sample, which is crucial when we know that opinions vary significantly by country.\n\n7) While cluster sampling might seem appealing due to cost and ease, stratified sampling is more appropriate here because we specifically need to account for country-level differences in opinions.\n\n8) Option F correctly identifies that we should divide the population into five strata (one for each country) and sample from each.\n\nANSWER: F", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "math", "question_id": 7701}}
