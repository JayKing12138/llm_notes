solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're dealing with: (0.0081)^(3/4)\n\n2) Let's rewrite 0.0081 as a fraction:\n   0.0081 = 81/10000\n\n3) So we have: (81/10000)^(3/4)\n\n4) We can break this down as:\n   (81^(3/4)) / (10000^(3/4))\n\n5) Let's simplify each part:\n   81 = 3^4, so 81^(3/4) = (3^4)^(3/4) = 3^3 = 27\n   10000 = 10^4, so 10000^(3/4) = (10^4)^(3/4) = 10^3 = 1000\n\n6) So we get: 27/1000\n\n7) This is equivalent to: 27/1000 = 27/(10^3)\n\n8) Looking at the options, we need to find which one equals 27/1000\n   27/1000 = 27/(10×100) = 27/1000\n\n9) Looking
