He is a political philosopher known for his work on cosmopolitanism and immigration.\n\n2) Looking at the options, I need to identify which one aligns with Wellman's well-known arguments. Wellman is particularly known for his defense of liberal cosmopolitanism.\n\n3) Wellman argues that liberal cosmopolitanism (the view that all people have rights regardless of nationality) is compatible with anti-egalitarianism (the view that some people have more rights than others).\n\n4) This is a key point in Wellman's philosophy - he argues that even in a liberal cosmopolitan framework, we can maintain some form of anti-egalitarianism, particularly regarding the rights of citizens versus non-citizens.\n\n5) Looking at the options, option D says anti-egalitarianism is incompatible with liberal cosmopolitanism - this contradicts Wellman's view.\n\n6) Option E states that anti-egalitarianism is compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism - this matches Wellman's actual position.\n\n7) The other options either represent different philosophical positions or are not aligned with Wellman's specific arguments.\n\n8) Wellman's work specifically defends the compatibility of anti-egalitarianism with liberal cosmopolitanism, which is exactly what option E states.\n\nANSWER: E", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-eval"}], "metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "philosophy", "question_id": 10792}}
