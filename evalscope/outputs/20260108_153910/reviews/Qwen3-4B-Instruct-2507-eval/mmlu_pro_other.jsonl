The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nE) The response to TNC post-Cold War has been largely focused on the implementation of strict border controls and immigration policies.\nF) The threat of TNC has been primarily addressed through the expansion of domestic law enforcement agencies, with minimal international cooperation.\nG) Governments have remained passive and unresponsive to the threat of TNC post-Cold War, allowing transnational crime to flourish unchecked.\n", "target": "D", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"acc": 1.0}, "extracted_prediction": "D", "prediction": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what TNC means - Transnational Corporations (TNCs) are companies that operate across national borders.

In year 4 Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. In year 5 the stock split 2-for-1. In the current year Lemon sold 800 shares.
