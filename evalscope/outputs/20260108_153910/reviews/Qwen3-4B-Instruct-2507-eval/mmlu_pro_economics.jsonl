Savers provide the supply of loanable funds, not demand. The demand for loanable funds comes from borrowers (businesses, governments, individuals).\n\n3) Option B: Real GDP is the sum of the money supply and the velocity of money\n- This is incorrect. Real GDP is not calculated this way. The quantity theory of money relates money supply, velocity, price level, and real GDP.\n\n4) Option C: The supply of loanable funds is solely determined by the central bank's policies\n- This is incorrect. The supply of loanable funds comes from savers and investors, not solely from central bank policies.\n\n5) Option D: Dollars earned today have more purchasing power than dollars earned a year from today\n- This is generally true, assuming inflation.
