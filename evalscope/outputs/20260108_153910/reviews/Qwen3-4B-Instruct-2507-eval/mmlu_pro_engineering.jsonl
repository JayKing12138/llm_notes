However, when the operating wavelength is smaller than the cutoff wavelength, the waveguide becomes \"lossy\" and has significant attenuation.\n\n3) The relationship between operating wavelength (λ₀) and cutoff wavelength (λ_oc) is important:\n   - λ₀ = 2 meters\n   - λ_oc = 20 cm = 0.2 meters\n\n4) The ratio of operating wavelength to cutoff wavelength is:\n   λ₀/λ_oc = 2/0.2 = 10\n\n5) In waveguides, when the operating wavelength is much larger than the cutoff wavelength (λ₀ >> λ_oc), the attenuation is very low.

This is a two-phase system.\n\n2) At 225°F, we need to find the pressure. The key information given is that at 212°F (boiling point at 1 atm), the enthalpy of vaporization is 970.3 Btu/lbm.\n\n3) The temperature given (225°F) is above the normal boiling point of water (212°F), so we're dealing with superheated steam or a mixture at a higher temperature.\n\n4) For a two-phase mixture, the pressure is determined by the saturation pressure at that temperature. Since we're given data at 212°F, we need to determine the pressure at 225°F.\n\n5) Looking at the options, we need to find which pressure corresponds to 225°F. The pressure increases with temperature in a saturated system.\n\n6) At 212°F, the pressure is 1 atm = 14.7 psi. At 225°F, the pressure will be higher than 14.7 psi.\n\n7) Looking at the options, the values range from 12.75 to 22.50 psi. Since 225°F is above 212°F, the pressure should be higher than 14.7 psi.\n\n8) Among the options, 17.30 psi (option B) is a reasonable value for the pressure at 225°F, as it's higher than 14.7 psi but not excessively so.\n\nANSWER: B", "explanation": null, "metadata": {}, "main_score_name": null}, "sample_id": 10, "group_id": 10, "sample_metadata": {"cot_content": "", "subject": "engineering", "question_id": 11295}}}
